# LARS 2024 Tutorial: Design and Control of Aerial Robots
This tutorial comprises a series of six practices that start from the dynamics of a free fall to the design of a multi-rotor vehicle.
The practices are the following:

* [Practice 1: Free fall](./P1%20-%20Free%20fall.ipynb)
* [Practice 2: Hovering](./P2%20-%20Hovering.ipynb)
* [Practice 3: Translating](./P3%20-%20Translating.ipynb)
* [Practice 4: Rotating](./P4%20-%20Rotating.ipynb)
* [Practice 5: Translating and rotating](./P5%20-%20Translating%20and%20rotating.ipynb)
* [Practice 6: Multirotor design](./P6%20-%20Multirotor%20design.ipynb)
